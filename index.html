    <h2>Top disruptive technologies this year:</h2>
<h3>
    
Wearable technologies:</h3> will be massive: despite some projects not being received as well with the general public, industry has seen some good application in logistics and technical tasks where an augmented reality display to relay key information has seen good use.
<h3>Internet of things:</h3>
While not a new idea the always online smartphone connected consumers are almost ready for wifi enabled everything with an app to control it. 
with potential for a lot of innovation in home appliances, and home automation and conditioning.
