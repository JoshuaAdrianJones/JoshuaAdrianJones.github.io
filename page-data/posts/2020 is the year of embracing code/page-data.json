I learned a lot but decided code wasn’t for me.\nI felt much more at home making physical stuff so I went to study mechanical engineering instead. I learned, built, and got a masters degree along the way. </p>\n<p>Code did keep pulling me back every now and then, while interning for cummins turbo technologies I wrote data analysis scripts in Python as one of the few people in my department who could.</p>\n<p>After my masters degree I went into programme (project) management at Aston Martin launching new models. I spent 2 years at Aston Martin and during that time I started taking tutorials on <a href=\"http://freecodecamp.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">freecodecamp.com</a> to learn fullstack javascript development just as a hobby.</p>\n<p>I found a <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://news.ycombinator.com/</a> “who’s hiring?” thread for a programming job, completed a few take home tests and some team-fit calls and now I work for an American start up company that is fully remote! Since September I’ve been writing Javascript everyday at home!</p>\n<h1 id=\"what-im-learning-in-january\"><a href=\"#what-im-learning-in-january\" aria-label=\"what im learning in january permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>What I’m learning in January</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>ReactJS  - which incidentally is how this blog is made.</li>\n<li>Redux</li>\n<li>Typescript  </li>\n</ul>","fields":{"slug":"/posts/2020 is the year of embracing code","tagSlugs":["/tag/productivity/","/tag/goal-setting/","/tag/habit-building/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2020-01-06","description":"how I got here","tags":["Productivity","Goal Setting","Habit Building"],"title":"Hello 2020!","socialImage":"/media/hny.jpg"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/posts/2020 is the year of embracing code"}}}
