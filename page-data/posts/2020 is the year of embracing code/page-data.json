I learned, I built things, and I got a masters degree along the way. </p>\n<p>Code did keep pulling me back every now and then, while interning for cummins turbo technologies I wrote data analysis scripts in Python as one of the few people in my department who could to predict how damaged they get in use.</p>\n<p>After my masters degree I went into programme (project) management at Aston Martin launching new models. </p>\n<p>I spent 2 years at Aston Martin and during that time I started taking tutorials on <a href=\"http://freecodecamp.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">freecodecamp.com</a> to learn fullstack javascript development as a hobby.</p>\n<p>I found a <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://news.ycombinator.com/</a> “who’s hiring?” thread for a programming job, completed a few take home tests and some team-fit calls and now I work for an American start up company that is fully remote! </p>\n<p><strong>Since September I’ve been writing Javascript everyday at home!</strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"what-im-learning-this-year\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#what-im-learning-this-year\" aria-label=\"what im learning this year permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>What I’m learning this year</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>ReactJS  - which incidentally is how this blog is made.</li>\n<li>Redux</li>\n<li>Typescript</li>\n<li>Redux.</li>\n<li>Typescript.</li>\n<li>Css / Sass.</li>\n<li>I can use css frameworks like bootstrap, bulma, and tailwindCSS.</li>\n<li>I am also able to write python for engineering and web applications.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"what-im-reading-in-january\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#what-im-reading-in-january\" aria-label=\"what im reading in january permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>What I’m reading in January</h2>\n<h3 id=\"i-finished-reading-the-checklist-manifesto-by-atul-gawande\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#i-finished-reading-the-checklist-manifesto-by-atul-gawande\" aria-label=\"i finished reading the checklist manifesto by atul gawande permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>I finished reading The Checklist Manifesto by Atul Gawande</h3>\n<p>This book is all about how to get things right in a world where our work is increasingly complex.</p>\n<p>It follows the path of Atul, a leading surgeon, on his study of checklists used by pilots and other professions and how their use in operating theaters around the world dramatically lowered surgery complications and deaths.</p>\n<p>Atul gives us an entertaining story but also the introspection on how checklists can help anyones job become less error prone and improve the quality and safety checks in whatever we might happen to be doing.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Checklist_Manifesto\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Link to the book on wiki</a></p>","fields":{"slug":"/posts/2020 is the year of embracing code","tagSlugs":["/tag/productivity/","/tag/goal-setting/","/tag/habit-building/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2020-01-06","description":"2020 is the year of embracing code and becoming a software engineer!","tags":["Productivity","Goal Setting","Habit Building"],"title":"Hello 2020!","socialImage":"/media/hny.jpg"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/posts/2020 is the year of embracing code"}},"staticQueryHashes":["251939775","3042332457","401334301"]}
